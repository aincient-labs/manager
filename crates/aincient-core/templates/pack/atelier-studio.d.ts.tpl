/**
 * The pack-studio mount contract — the ONE browser API a client pack's studio
 * binds to (plans/console-extension-point.md Phase 4, DECISIONS 0448).
 *
 * A built-in studio is compiled source: its `ui.entry` exports React components
 * and our build bundles them (`studio-module.ts`). A PACK studio is code our
 * build never sees — it lives in a derived image — so it gets a boundary
 * instead: the manifest names a built ES module (`ui.script`), the console
 * `import()`s it and calls
 *
 *     export const apiVersion = 1;
 *     export function mount(el, ctx) { …; return { unmount() { … } }; }
 *
 * React never crosses the boundary. The pack renders into `el` with whatever it
 * likes (plain DOM, Preact, Svelte, its own bundled React) and talks to the
 * console only through `ctx`. That makes a pack studio an island, on purpose:
 * no shared page draft, no editor lock, no preview pane, no chat cards — a
 * narrow contract we can widen beats a wide one we must keep.
 *
 * Styling: the rail sits in the console's DOM, so the system `--ain-*` tokens
 * and the light/dark mode are inherited for free. Read SYSTEM tokens only
 * (`--ain-color-surface`, `--ain-color-text`, …) — never `--ain-ref-*` and never the kit's
 * classes; those are ours to move.
 *
 * WHAT WE PROMISE NOT TO BREAK within `apiVersion` 1: the `mount` / `unmount`
 * signature and every member of {@link StudioMountContext} below. Anything not
 * in this file is internal. A breaking change bumps {@link STUDIO_MOUNT_API_VERSION};
 * a studio built against another version renders a named placeholder instead
 * of mounting — it never breaks the console.
 *
 * This file is dependency-free on purpose: it is the source of the `.d.ts` the
 * pack template ships, so it may not import anything from the console.
